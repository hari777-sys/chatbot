IT'S  A PERSONAL CHATBOT WHICH WORKS ON THE USER DATA 
 I've used langchain and openai for this project and used the flask  framework
   * To work with this first create a directory named data in the same directory where you are having the project
   * add the data as txt files in the directory
   * create another .py file and name it as constants
   * inside that add your api key APIKEY = "<TYPE-YOUR-KEY>"
   * the key can he get from openai which we used in this app
